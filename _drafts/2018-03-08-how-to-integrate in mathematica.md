When working with double and triple integrals, it is helpful to have a computational engine nearby to check your work, especially when changing order of integration or coordinate systems.

In _Mathematica_, the `Integrate[]` function handles this, and you can certainly read its documentation, but to make it a bit more math-y, do the following:

  1. Click (with the horizontal cursor) to open a new input cell.
  2. Type <kbd>esc</kbd>dintt<kbd>esc</kbd>. This stands for **d**efinite **int**egral **t**emplate.
